1. Python is a interpreter language(runs line by line) the most famous interpreter is CPython.
   But it have some compiled properties also   example when we run .py file so first it compiled it into byte
   code(low lever representation and platform independent). The byte code than excecuted by PVM(python 
   virtual machine).

2.   Attributes in Python
      Global--> variables are public and can be acessed by anywhere.
      Protected--> attributes are marked with a single underscore(eg: _sara). while they can still be acessed 
                and modified outside of a class.
     Private --> marked by double underscore(eg: __sara) and not modified and acessed outside the class.
